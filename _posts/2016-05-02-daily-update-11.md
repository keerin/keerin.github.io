The Codeschool RSpec course is really well done. I've done another level this evening. It covered filters and hooks. I wrote all my notes up in an rb file as comments along with the code examples. This really helped me understand what I needed to do in the challenges.

It's frustrating that the errors I make are syntax based. I totally understand what I'm supposed to do, but I keep writing the examples wrong. That's fine, just frustrating! I'll just keep going, and when I have to write my own tests, I'll just keep breaking things until they work, including the syntax :)
