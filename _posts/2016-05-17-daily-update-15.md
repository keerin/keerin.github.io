Started Rails For Zombies 2 today, and I've just done the first level because I wanted to go to the gym. Just about to head there now actually.

The first level covered some stuff I haven't done yet which is a great sign for this course. Level one covers:

* The "rails new <...>" command
* Generating a scaffold
* Creating a table
* Runing a migration
* Booting the Rails app up
* Adding a column to a table - NEW
* Creating migration by hand - NEW
* Rollback migrations - NEW
* Changing tables - NEW
* Removing columns - NEW
* Database Setup - NEW
* Working in the Console

Loking forward to getting stuck into level two tomorrow. No reason I can't do a level a day for the week. There are five levels.
