Here are some small project for me to do on a rainy day/weekend. I'll update this when I add or complete these.

1. Have each blog post from here submit to Twitter automatically.
2. Create an app to find people near you who are bored
3. Personal dashboard using multiple APIs (to be used on a Raspberry Pi)
4. Command line to-do app that syncs to Google Drive or Dropbox to store these instead of locally
