I've always been terrible at keeping track of my money. For too many months I get to the end only to have literally not even a penny. All of my bills get paid of course, but maybe not on time...

I decided to build a tool that would let me add all my outgoings, then deduct these from my incomings and not only show me what I have left which was safe to spend, but also email me this so I had a reminder on the first of every month.

This post will detail the user stories I've written for what I have called Spendsloth. The user stories details the minimum fuctionality I believe will be required for any kind of release - an "MVP" so to speak.

Below are all use cases I can imagine at this point. Each will be represented by a test. 

Below each is my estimated development time. I will time my work in Toggl and track progress in Trello.

This looks like it will take two weeks to go from git init to MVP (core functionality, bare bones front-end), with an average of 2.5hrs a day spent on the project.
