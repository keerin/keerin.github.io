I didn't really feel like doing anything backend related today so I've gone and learned the basics of Bootstrap (4) and given my basic blog a very basic frontend haha

I'll post a screenshot shortly, just to show exactly how simple I am talking here.

It was actually fun to learn about using Bootstrap, I can see why so many people use it.

I learned by watching [Travis from DevTips](URL){:target="_blank"}
 building a design he found online in Bootstrap. He has [also done the same with Foundation](URL){:target="_blank"}, which is a playlist I also plan to watch, just to see what the differences are.
