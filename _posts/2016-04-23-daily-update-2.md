## Blog to track progress

You are looking at it! Not messing about with themes and things right now. Let's go for the default theme, and improve when the more important things have been sorted.

## Wrapping up existing projects

Still not done anything so far on these. I get excited by new things too easily, and get carried away. I need to ensure I do wrap these up however.

## Rails

This morning I've gone through the MacKenzie Child [Intro to Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gUbteh54RM&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPKnwg3lMv-JGNCn08kB0wsA){:target="_blank"} videos, just to try out Rails.
(_Edit: I've written my notes up [here](/learning-rails/2016/04/23/intro-to-rails-creating-a-blog/)_)

I've put the code from this video series on [my GitHub](https://github.com/keerin/mackenzie-blog){:target="_blank"}. It is very ugly as there is zero design behind it, but it helped me understand what Rails generates, and how to work with it on a basic level.

## Miscellaneous

### Workspace

This is all set up and looking great! I want to get a nice set of speakers, a monitor stand and a better seat, but what I have right now works fine and has increased my productivity already. Just having two monitors really helps.

I'll be buying a monitor stand next week, a new chair the month after, and then maybe speakers after that. The speakers from my laptop are fine, but I;d really like a nice speaker system because I'm a massive child.
