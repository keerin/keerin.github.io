Today I signed up for CodeSchool.com and worked through levels 1-3 of their RSpec course. I'm on level 4 right now, and i am hoping to have completed this course by the end of Wednesday

After that, I'll fix my manage page so that it stands alone instead of sitting inside the Posts actions.

Then I'll put what I've learned in this course to good use and rebuild my blog from scratch, test first.

I really like the way things are taught in this CodeSchool course. A colleague said it would be worthwhile supplementing my learning with the Rails for Zombies course as well. I'm already paying for it so I might as well!
