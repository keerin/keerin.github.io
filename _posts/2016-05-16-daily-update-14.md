Started and finished Rails for Zombies yesterday.

My target for May looks like this:

 * <s>Try Ruby</s>
 * <s>Ruby Bits 1</s>
 * <s>Testing with RSpec</s>
 * <s>Rails for Zombies Redux</s>
 * Rails for Zombies 2
 * Rails Testing for Zombies

Going to start on Rails for Zombies 2 tomorrow morning. If I can complete this in a week, then I can do Rails Testing for Zombies the week after. This will mean I've covered 60% of the Ruby material in CodeSchool inside a month which is not too bad at all!

After this, I'll get back to sorting out my blog, and then redoing it test-first after that. That will be the goal for the start of June. I want to have everything built for my blog and CMS by the end of June, so I still have a chance of being able to hit my goal of being an employable RoR dev by the end of the year.
