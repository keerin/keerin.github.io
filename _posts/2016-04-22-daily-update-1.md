## Blog to track progress

I've not done anything on this today. Going to do it all tomorrow.

## Wrapping up existing projects

Again, nothing done here. I want to wrap up Pommy tomorrow. I'm not sure how Accountables broke so I might put off fixing it until the end, when I've learned more. 

## Rails

I've bought the Agile Rails book, because it not only runs you through setting up and working with Rails in an Agile manner as you would expect, but it does so through building a eCommerce website! If that wasn't enough, DHH is a co-author.

I've set up Rails on my laptop tonight, and I'll start working through MacKenzie Child's tutorial tomorrow morning.

## Miscellaneous

### Workspace

I've also bought a VGA to HDMI adapter so I can use both of my VGA-only monitors with my laptop, which has one VGA port and one HDMI port. The laptop's display settings, the monitors, and the workstation are all set up. Just waiting for that adapter!

### Development environment

Maybe goes without saying, but my development environment is totally set up as well. I'm using Gedit with a few plugins added so I have a Terminal built in at the bottom, and a directory tree to the left, with the main window containing text editing tabs. I've got two space tabs set up, with autocomplete and syntax highlighting, as well as snippets and auto-save enabled.

This will be my setup until I can touch type 40wpm, at which point I'll start to learn how to use Vim and Tmux. I'll then have a somewhat visually similar layout, but wholly in the Terminal. :)
