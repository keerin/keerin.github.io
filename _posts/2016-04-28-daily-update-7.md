I had a great chat with a developer at work today about Rails and Ruby. Sometimes I feel like a total noob, which I probably am. But when we were chatting today, I realised I do know quite a lot. I guess you could lump this in with "imposter syndrome", but it was reassuring to see that the resources and ideas he recommended for me were things I have already learned about. He actually said he could see I was serious about Ruby because I know about multiple inheritance.

In terms of actual work, I've read through guides on the Rails site about views, layouts and rendering.
