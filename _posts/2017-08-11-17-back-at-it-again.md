I've been working on the Michale Hartl Ruby on Rails tutorial for a while now. Instead of putting any pressure on myself, I have just done what I can when I can. I'm at 70% through so far, so I'm pretty happy with that.

I have been aiming to have it completed by the end of August as I have a specific project I want to work on and want to finish for the end of October.

NB - I forgot how awesome Jekyll is!
