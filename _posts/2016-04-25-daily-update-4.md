There will actually be no progress today. I slept in this morning, and we have people over tonight to watch Game of Thrones. I'll just have to do some work tomorrow morning **and** evening to make up for it :)

I plan on ensuring Devise is set up correctly and I understand how to add user authenitication to certain pages in the morning, and then building my admin page views in the evening.
